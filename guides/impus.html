				<p>Impus can be found on the northern coast of the small island on the west side of the Broken Shore.</p>
				<div class="location" data-map="impus"></div>
				<p>While on the coast, you'll get an aura which allows you to fish up <b data-link-item="146963">Desecrated Seaweed</b>. Handing these to Impus will increase your reputation with him; they're also used as currency for the items he sells.</p>
				<ul class="breakdown">
					<li><b data-link-item="146963">Desecrated Seaweed</b> give <span data-value="75" data-filter="source-quest"></span> reputation each. <span data-total="75" data-filter="source-quest" data-text="(%d more needed)"></span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>While fishing at this location, you also have a chance to reel in a <b data-link-item="146969">Faintly Pulsing Felstone</b>. This can be thrown back into the water to summon an Infernal Destroyer, who once defeated increases the catch-rate of <b data-link-item="146963">Desecrated Seaweed</b> to 100% for a short time.</p>
				<p>It's best to farm this reputation in a group, as more people getting the <b data-link-item="146969">Faintly Pulsing Felstone</b>, the faster it will go!</p>
